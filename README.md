# Coding-Examples
A showcase of my work in machine learning and statistics!

I am a data scientist and biostatistician showcasing my work using publicly available datasets! Currently the repository contains a deep learning model for skin disease classification, obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sponishflea/classification-of-skin-diseases/data). Specifically, this code showcases data splitting for validation and training sets, as well as the utilization of ResNet18 to classify each picture from the 5 different outcomes available, where F1-score is the model performance metric. 

The best performing model configuration achieved an overall validation macro F1-score of 0.932.

The 2nd set of code showcases utilizing XGBoost for depression prediction with bayesian optimization with 10-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, with AUROC as the model performance metric. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aldinwhyudii/student-depression-and-lifestyle-100k-data/data). The code also displays data cleaning methodologies to prepare the data for use in the model, as well as training and testing splits to train the model and evalute the model on unseen data.

The best performing model configuration achieved a test set AUROC of 0.712.


Thank you for your time!
