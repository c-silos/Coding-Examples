# Coding-Examples
A showcase of my work in machine learning and statistics!

I am a data scientist and biostatistician showcasing my work using publicly available datasets! Currently the repository contains a deep learning model for skin disease classification, obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sponishflea/classification-of-skin-diseases/data). Specifically, this code showcases data splitting for validation and training sets, as well as the utilization of ResNet18 to classify each picture from the 5 different outcomes available, where F1-score is the classification metric.

The best performing iteration of the deep learning model achieved an overall validation macro F1-score of 0.932.
